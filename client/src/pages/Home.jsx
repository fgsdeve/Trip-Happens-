      <p>
        Coming up with a travel itinerary can be tedious and at times,
        stressful. We wanted to change that potentially negative planning
        experience into an easy one. All you have to do is pick what country you
        would like to travel to, answer a few questions, and we will do the
        rest. You will get an itinerary based on your selections with a rough
        estimate how much the trip would cost. Our site is completely free to
        use! To get started just create an account and start planning your dream
        trip.
